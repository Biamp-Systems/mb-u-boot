NOTE - In order to operate with boards populated with either a 1 Gib
       or a 512 Mib DDR2 part, the device tree file must be hand-modified
       to declare a 512 Mib memory space to uClinux:

In ./xilinx.dts, change:

        ddr2_control: memory@88000000 {
                device_type = "memory";
                reg = < 0x88000000 0x8000000 >;
        } ;
   
to:

        ddr2_control: memory@88000000 {
                device_type = "memory";
                reg = < 0x88000000 0x4000000 >;
        } ;
   
This must be done anytime the .dts file is updated, i.e. when it has been
re-generated by the Xilinx SDK tools for any reason.
